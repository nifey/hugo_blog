Disclaimer: I'm no expert in this. This post is just to collect all my thoughts and lessons learnt from random talks and blogs, about research.

**What is research?**

Research is producing new knowledge.
The aim of research is to do something **novel** (new) and **useful**.
The purpose of literature survey is to ensure that whatever idea we come up with is new and has not been proposed before.
And the purpose of evaluations is to show that our idea or technique is useful.

**How to do research?**

The research process: I like to think of the process as a pipeline. It's kind of like a computer. We have input, processing and output.

1.  **Input**: reading about ideas (in papers, courses or blogs) and learning new skills. (Skills are about _how to_ do something, while ideas are about _what_)
2.  **Processing**: critiquing ideas, generating new ideas and evaluating them. This is where the real knowledge generation happens.
3.  **Output**: writing about your ideas (in papers mainly), presenting your ideas to other researchers and discussing them.


## Input {#input}

The primary source of ideas and information is research papers.
We can also get it from other documents, blogs and conference presentations.

Some of the general skills you will need as a researcher are

1.  Touch typing
2.  LaTeX: Use for typesetting all your reports, papers, slides, etc. LaTeX (and bibtex) allows us to forget about formatting, citation styles, etc and focus on the content. Most conferences provide LaTeX templates for their papers that follows the conference formatting guidelines. If you use their template, you don't have to worry about the conference's formatting guidelines at all.
3.  Writing: You will be spending a lot of time writing about things. So it's better to get good at it.

### Coming up with new ideas {#coming-up-with-new-ideas}

This is the crux of research. How do we come up with something new?
There are a few strategies.

1.  Borrow from a different context/subject
2.  Identify gaps: The table method
    This was suggested to me by Prof.Rupesh Nasre. It involves creating a table, where columns and rows represent different dimensions of the problem. Now we classify all the existing works in the area based on these two (or more) dimensions. Finally, identify boxes where there are not much work done.
3.  Identify all possible techniques that could be used to solve a problem


### Automation {#automation}

When evaluating, it helps to automate as much as possible.
Especially in systems research, where evaluation usually involves combining multiple software tools together to perform something.
We can automate running experiments, collecting logs/output and generating some basic plots out of the data so that you can reason about the results visually.
