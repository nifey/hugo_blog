      <description>A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a piece of code that can be loaded to a running kernel to add additional functionality to the kernel. The code that runs as a kernel module will be executed with kernel privileges. Most operating system kernels support kernel modules.
The advantage of using kernel modules is that it can be loaded to and unloaded from the kernel without the need to recompile or reboot the kernel.</description>

      <description>In this post, I want to share what I did for Hacktoberfest.
Hacktoberfest is a month-long program to motivate people to contribute to open source software. All you have to do is give 4 pull requests to any public repository on Github. The reward is a cool t-shirt and Github stickers. These contributions should be made in the month of October to be counted for hacktoberfest.
I searched for a project I can contribute to.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I am writing about my experience participating in the MozillaTN community meetup held at Coimbatore this January.
Mozilla is a global community of passionate people working to protect the web as an open resource. I was always interested in Mozilla for 2 reasons. First, Mozilla is one of the pioneers of the open source movement. As far as I remember, Mozilla Firefox was the first open source software I have ever used.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language Rust is a system programming language that focusses on three aspects: Speed, Safety and Concurrency. It is being developed by an active community of programmers. Its development is officially sponsored by Mozilla.
Installing rust First, we have to install the rust compiler which is called rustc and cargo ,rust&amp;rsquo;s package manager. I recommend installing rustc and cargo using rustup. Why rustup? Before answering that I have to mention that rustc comes in three versions : Stable , Beta and Nightly.</description>
