      <description>Character Devices, Major and Minor numbers Based on granularity of access, there are two classes of devices:
 Character devices are accessed as a stream of bytes. Eg: Keyboards Block devices are accessed in blocks. For instance, hard disks transfer data in blocks of multiple bytes at a time.  The kernel uses major and minor numbers to identify the attached hardware devices. Major number usually tells us the type of device.</description>

      <description>In this post, I want to share what I learnt by doing task 5 of the Eudyptula challenge.
The Eudyptula Challenge is a set of 20 tasks designed to help people get started with Linux kernel development.
Task 5 of the challenge is to make a hello world kernel module get loaded automatically when a USB keyboard is plugged in.
Loadable kernel modules Linux kernel allows us to load modules to the kernel while the kernel is running.</description>

      <title>Hello world Linux Kernel Module</title>

      <description>A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a piece of code that can be loaded to a running kernel to add additional functionality to the kernel. The code that runs as a kernel module will be executed with kernel privileges. Most operating system kernels support kernel modules.
The advantage of using kernel modules is that it can be loaded to and unloaded from the kernel without the need to recompile or reboot the kernel.</description>
