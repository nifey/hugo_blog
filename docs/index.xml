      <description>Compression is a common technique that allows us to reduce the size of data. We use it when we store or send files as zip, 7z or rar archives. It helps reduce the space occupied by files in the filesystem and also to save bandwidth while transferring over a network.
In general, compression algorithms try to encode redundancy or regularity in data with lesser bits.
There are many different software compression algorithms available.</description>

      <description>FOSSHack 2021 FOSSHack 2021 is a remote hackathon, organized by FOSSUnited, that happened on 13-14 November. FOSSUnited is a non-profit foundation that seeks to foster more FOSS projects and contributors from India and this hackathon is one such initiative.
The rules were simple: Build a FOSS project or Work on existing FOSS project during the weekend. The projects would be judged based on factors like technical complexity, completeness and utility.</description>

      <title>Publishing packages to PyPI</title>

      <description>The usability of a programming language depends on many factors and one of them is the availability of good libraries to build on. When libraries are available, we also need a way to search and download libraries with ease. Most modern langauges maintain some form of index to make dependency management easier. Examples include Crates.io for Rust and PyPI for Python.
Python Package Index (PyPI) is an index and repository of Python packages.</description>

      <description>The kernel provides a few ways in which userspace programs can get information from the kernel space.
 procfs: Used to get information about running processes debugfs: Used by kernel developers for debugging sysfs  Sysfs is used for data that is not related to a particular process. It has information about hardware devices attached to the system and about drivers handling those devices.
Any file added to the sysfs becomes a part of the Linux Application Binary Interface (ABI).</description>

      <description>Accessing hardware devices like files An important role of the operating system is to allow the user applications to access hardware resources. It has to allow the user programs to use hardware while also ensuring that the applications have permissions to access it and don&amp;rsquo;t misuse them.
To simplify access to hardware, Unix, by design, exposes most of the hardware devices to userspace as device files, usually present under /dev directory.</description>

      <description>debugfs debugfs is a pseudo-filesystem used for kernel debugging. It is usually mounted at /sys/kernel/debug. debugfs contains files that allow us to read debugging information.
By default, only the root user can cd into the /sys/kernel/debug directory.
To change it to allow the current user to cd into debugfs, we can remount it with uid set to the current user&amp;rsquo;s uid.
1 2 3  sudo umount /sys/kernel/debug sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug -o uid=`echo $UID` cd /sys/kernel/debug   Creating debugfs entries Creating debugfs files is similar to creating character device files.</description>

      <description>Character Devices, Major and Minor numbers Based on granularity of access, there are two classes of devices:
 Character devices are accessed as a stream of bytes. Eg: Keyboards Block devices are accessed in blocks. For instance, hard disks transfer data in blocks of multiple bytes at a time.  The kernel uses major and minor numbers to identify the attached hardware devices. Major number usually tells us the type of device.</description>

      <description>Finding vulnerable dependencies Safety-db is a database that keeps track of vulnerable python packages and version information. It is updated once a month. They also provide a tool called safety, that checks if the installed packages or packages in requirements.txt are identified as vulnerable using the safety-db.
  Install safety

      <description>In this post, I want to share what I learnt by doing task 5 of the Eudyptula challenge.
The Eudyptula Challenge is a set of 20 tasks designed to help people get started with Linux kernel development.
Task 5 of the challenge is to make a hello world kernel module get loaded automatically when a USB keyboard is plugged in.
Loadable kernel modules Linux kernel allows us to load modules to the kernel while the kernel is running.</description>

      <description>You need a backup When was the last time you took a backup of your files? Thanks to technology, today, we can store thousands of photos and videos in a single pen drive. Digital files are easy to store, but they are also easy to lose. And that is why we all need to take regular backup of our files.
3-2-1 Backup Strategy 3-2-1 Backup strategy is a general rule of thumb that says it is better to have atleast 3 copies of our files.</description>

      <description>A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a piece of code that can be loaded to a running kernel to add additional functionality to the kernel. The code that runs as a kernel module will be executed with kernel privileges. Most operating system kernels support kernel modules.
The advantage of using kernel modules is that it can be loaded to and unloaded from the kernel without the need to recompile or reboot the kernel.</description>

      <description>In this post, I want to share what I did for Hacktoberfest.
Hacktoberfest is a month-long program to motivate people to contribute to open source software. All you have to do is give 4 pull requests to any public repository on Github. The reward is a cool t-shirt and Github stickers. These contributions should be made in the month of October to be counted for hacktoberfest.
I searched for a project I can contribute to.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I want to share my experience participating in the JS13Kgames game jam.
About a month ago, I got a chance to participate in the JS13Kgames. JS13kgames is an HTML5 game development competition that happens from 13th August till 13th September. The goal of this competition is to make a game in under 13 kilobytes including all the game assets. For this game jam, I made a two-player game called &amp;ldquo;Lost in the woods&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I am writing about my experience participating in the MozillaTN community meetup held at Coimbatore this January.
Mozilla is a global community of passionate people working to protect the web as an open resource. I was always interested in Mozilla for 2 reasons. First, Mozilla is one of the pioneers of the open source movement. As far as I remember, Mozilla Firefox was the first open source software I have ever used.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am sharing my goals for the next 6 months.
The reason I&amp;rsquo;m doing this is to keep myself motivated and also to let other mozillians know what I&amp;rsquo;m up to.
 Learn Rust. Learning more about the rust language is my first priority. In this 6 months I want to learn about:  Unit Testing Networking in rust basics of functional programming If possible, using threads in rust   Contribute to some simple, open source rust projects.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language Rust is a system programming language that focusses on three aspects: Speed, Safety and Concurrency. It is being developed by an active community of programmers. Its development is officially sponsored by Mozilla.
Installing rust First, we have to install the rust compiler which is called rustc and cargo ,rust&amp;rsquo;s package manager. I recommend installing rustc and cargo using rustup. Why rustup? Before answering that I have to mention that rustc comes in three versions : Stable , Beta and Nightly.</description>
